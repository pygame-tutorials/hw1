Question 4
PR and repo are common abbreviations in the world of Git. What do they mean?

PR stand for ‘Pull Request’ a feature in GitHub used for collaborative work in a team-based environment a way to propose changes for the original code. When developers fix bugs in their own branch of a repository they would submit a pull request to the main repository owner, request to review and merge these changes to the main code. Pull requests enable developers to discuss and review code through suggested modifications for improvements which can be incorporated into the main code. 

Repo is short for ‘repository’. A repository is a central storage space where a project’s code, version history and related files are stored in Git. A Git repository allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project through version control, tracking changes, merge modifications and work on different features concurrently.

Question 8
What does the git commit command need to work?

The command should be executed within a directory, create a new repository by using the command ‘git init’ which will initialise an empty Git repository.

The command ‘git commit’ is used to record the changes made, as a commit, to the repository.  The command requires staging changes and commit message.

Before running ‘git commit’ use ‘git add’ to select changes that will be staged for the next commit. 

When committing changes, a semantic commit message should be provided alongside that describes the purpose of the changes. 

Once completed ‘git command’ can be used.
